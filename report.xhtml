In 2023, 25% of the annual target bonus for the Management Board was tied to reducing CO₂ emissions in operational management at major Austrian locations. Additionally, specific targets were set for the CEO, CFO, and the Board member responsible for ESG, focusing on reducing the weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the investment portfolio, accounting for 20% of their annual bonus. Long-term incentives also incorporated ESG priorities, with 20% of targets linked to WACI reduction and increasing investments aligned with the Paris climate targets, as per the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria. This model is set to expand from 2024 onwards to include Management Boards in other markets and will incorporate social objectives.</span></span>

This process is integrated into their governance framework and is designed to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, and account for actual and potential adverse impacts on environmental and social factors. 

Governance and strategy integration ensures that sustainability considerations are central to decision-making processes, with clear responsibilities at the board and executive levels. Engaging stakeholders, such as customers, employees, suppliers, and communities, informs the identification and assessment of material impacts. UNIQA systematically identifies and assesses actual and potential negative impacts based on international frameworks, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 

The company implements actions to address significant impacts, such as ESG-compliant investment policies and sustainability criteria integration. Monitoring effectiveness is achieved through regular reviews, using KPIs and other metrics to evaluate progress and adapt as necessary. 

Detailed disclosures about the due diligence process, governance structures, stakeholder engagement, impact assessments, and actions taken are provided in UNIQA’s sustainability statements. Transparent reporting ensures that stakeholders understand UNIQA’s approach to managing sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.</span></span>
